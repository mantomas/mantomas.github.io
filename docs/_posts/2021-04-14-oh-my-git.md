As a loner with a few mini scripts in a drawer, I consider GitHub to be a kind of external hard drive for my semi-finished pieces of code. But as a prospective member of a team, I suspect that I should get to know GIT in depth, with all its useful features. So where to start?..

I discovered the game [OH MY GIT](https://ohmygit.org/) and it's really fun. In an interactive way, I learned more about the GIT concept in the first hour than I thought possible in such a short time. Suddenly, a relatively mysterious tool seems to me to be a very useful helper, not only when writing programs.

The **Oh My Git!** website states:
>*Oh My Git!* is an open source game that introduces players to the popular version control system "Git". It is highly interactive, and aims at building intuition for operations like "merging" or "rebasing" branches. Players are guided through the features of Git step by step â€“ each level tells a little story where the player can use their new-found powers to solve problems or help others.

So ''git init'' and dive in!
