Shortly after I decided to start learning Python, a concept popped into my head - a simple calculator that would help us in the store (where I worked) to check the cash register at the end of the day. Until then, we used a simple LibreOffice Calc document, but it seemed awkward (it took the program a very long time to run at all, the table was not clear enough and lacked some features).

I started writing the program after two weeks with Python and at the end of the month I had a working application that we still use today - [Cash register](https://github.com/mantomas/cash-register). Instead of a database, it stores data in a simple text file, has no menu and starts almost immediately.

To this day, I haven't really returned to that code, because it just wasn't needed and many interesting topics appeared on the horizon. But one day it has to happen, because it was my first functional application and I still have no idea how some of its functions work. In the beginning, for example, I didn't even know exactly how OOP works, and it's a bit of a shame - program glued from parts: *Idea* + *Stackoverflow* + *lots of searching*.
