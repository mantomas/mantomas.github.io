For the past few days I've been thinking about some **note-taking** app, as I was reading [Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/) and realise that I have no other *mind backup* than browser bookmarks, some books and pile of PDF's or EPUB's.
The only thing that was certain at first: **NO** paper!
But what other features do I want?

- simple to use
- searchable
- TAG's
- syntax highlighting
- easy backup and synchronization

So my first old-school thought was immediately rejected - LibreOffice and other text editors with folders full of separate files it's not an answer. Maybe something base on database?..

[Cherrytree](https://www.giuspen.com/cherrytree/) might be the perfect fit. Unfortunately before I found this feature rich beauty, whole pack of **markdown** editors was revealed to me and that was it.

Easy and simple [Notable](https://notable.app/) is one of my favorites, all files are simple markdown and there is a promisse of built-in synchronization in the future. Only one thing is bothering me: all files are automaticaly renamed acording to the first line in the file. Why? I don't know, but there is no option setting and it makes VCS a bit weird, like new files apearing and the old ones are gone.

As for now, I'm trying to find my way with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). It's little heavier, but full of useful features and with huge active community. Plenty of built-in features and dozens of community plugins. It has its own auto-synchronization, but you need to have an account and you have less control over your files. I'm all good with Github private repository and if I'll get lazy, there is a community plugin to do all commits automatically.
