My name is Tom and this is where I want to record my progress on the path to becoming a programmer. After reaching forty years, I decided to completely change my career and learn to program. I liked it so much that I would like to find my first junior job, even though I am slowly in the senior category in the life profession.

You can check my small projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/mantomas). My main focus is on Python and I'm trying to feel strong in it before I go for some other skils, like JS, Flask and other stuff I'm interested in.
