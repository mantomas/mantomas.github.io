![Tom](/assets/img/t.jpg)My name is Tomáš Man and this is where I want to record my progress on the path to becoming a programmer. After reaching forty years, I decided to completely change my career and learn to program. I liked it so much that I would like to find my first junior job, even though I am slowly in the senior category in the life profession.

You can check my small projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/mantomas). My main focus is on Python and I'm trying to feel strong in it before I go for some other skils, like JS, Flask and other stuff I'm interested in.

I live in Brno, Czech Republic. I use Linux since 2008 and I like the concept of open-source. I would like to find a job in a company that uses Linux as its main platform and whose code is as open as possible. Who knows where Python or programming as such will take me in the end?

In my free time I take care of [large garden](https://koridory.wordpress.com/) and my hobby is [photography](https://www.zonerama.com/TomasMan/200742).
