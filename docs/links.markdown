Some links I found useful along my way.

### Python
[CheckiO](https://py.checkio.org/) - a fitness center for practicing programming in Python, with a very useful opportunity to observe how others train.

### Bash
[Command Line Crash Course](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html) - appendix to the book *Learn Python 3 the Hard Way* - a very useful introduction to the command line basics.

### GIT
[Oh My GIT!](https://ohmygit.org/) - game-like introduction to the GIT version control system.
